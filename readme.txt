= Support Policy =

I will happily patch any confirmed bugs with this plugin, however, I will not offer support for:

1. Customisations of this plugin or any plugins it relies upon
2. Conflicts with "premium" themes from ThemeForest and similar marketplaces (due to bad practice and not being readily available to test)
3. CSS Styling (this is customisation work)

If you need help with customisation you will need to find and hire a developer or you can hire our developers or team for making the changes.

== Installation ==

To install this plugin, please refer to the guide here: [http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation)
